### Introduction

SmartHome ([check the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_fc6otGhpU) and [the second one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAViTllGdyo)) is a service built for fun which allow you to add dynamically actions and control any IoT devices who run at least one REST API service.

# Have fun !

## Possibilities are limitless :
You can interact with any RESTful API service

For exemple, controlling an AC is very simple ! Take a Tessel, put an IR blaster on it and control it through SmartHome (and put a climate sensor if you want to activate the AC when the temperature is below or over a value)

### TO DO :

Lot of improvments will come in few days.
